## Overview of Case Study
I investigated and identified key differences between two major groups of Cyclistic customers, casual riders who use single ride or day passes and members who have a yearly membership, as part of a project to convert casual riders to members, setting Cyclist up for future success. I used Excel to take an initial look at the data, which was first party data on rides taken by Cyclistic customers from March 2021 to March 2022 organized into monthly spreadsheets, identifying any obvious anomalies. Following that, I moved to using R in an RMarkdown file where I began to process the data and clean it. I then proceeded to analyze the data, finding several different trends in the two groups of customers, in particular where and when each group used Cyclisticâ€™s bikes. Finally I visualized the data and exported it to an HTML file, allowing the stakeholders to view the results and guide their decisions for the project going forward.
